**Description**

This project aims to create the foundation of a website which will work as a platform for people trying to get a water scoter license. The main functionality for the website is to display the chapters and subchapters of the theory needed to get the license. The website also differentiates between different kinds of users; students, moderators and supermoderators. **The intention is for moderators to be able to overview all their students' progress, although this has not been implemented yet.**

**Installation**

The project uses the React framework, and as such node.js is required. The project also uses Firebase for managing users and the included Firestore as a database.

To start the project, run the command `npm start` in the project directory (by default "agile_software").

**Features**

- Managing students: Moderators (i.e. educators) have an overview presented of their own students.
- Course material: Relevant course material is available by chapter and subchapter, with easy navigation between them. 
- Registration: New users can register when they have a reference from their teacher. Users can also register as educators, easily allowing new customers to start using the product.
